Hardware Connection
===================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

This document introduces what hardware you need to prepare and how to connect them in order to download AT firmware, send AT commands, and receive AT responses.

The commands supported by each series of AT firmware vary, and its compatibility with modules or chips also differs. For more information, refer to :doc:`/Compile_and_Develop/esp-at_firmware_differences`.

If you don't want to use the default AT pin, you can refer to the :doc:`/Compile_and_Develop/How_to_set_AT_port_pin` document to change the pin.

   Connection of Components for ESP-AT Testing

Note:

.. only:: esp32c2

  - The official default :doc:`../AT_Binary_Lists/index` only supports 26 MHz crystal oscillator. If your crystal oscillator of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is 40 MHz, please refer to :doc:`../Compile_and_Develop/How_to_clone_project_and_compile_it` document to compile {IDF_TARGET_NAME} AT firmware, and configurate in the step 5:

    ::

      python build.py menuconfig -> Component config -> Hardware Settings -> Main XTAL Config -> Main XTAL frequency -> 40 MHz

- In the above picture, four jump wires are used to connect the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board and USB to serial converter. If you do not use hardware flow control, two wires connecting TX/RX and a simpler converter will be enough.

.. only:: esp32 or esp32c6 or esp32s2

  - If you use an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} module instead of a development board and flash firmware via UART, you need to reserve the UART pins (refer to {IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL} > Section Pin Description for more details) and strapping pins (refer to {IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL} > Section Strapping Pins for more details), and enter the download mode by controlling the strapping pin level.

.. only:: esp32c2

  - If you use an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} module instead of a development board and flash firmware via UART, you need to reserve the UART pins (refer to {IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL} > Section Pin Description for more details) and one of the following conditions needs to be met:

    - Reserve the Strapping pins (refer to {IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL} > Section Strapping Pins for more details), and enter the download mode by controlling the Strapping pin level.
    - Enter the download mode by sending :ref:`AT+RST=1,1 <cmd-RST>` command.

.. only:: esp32c3

  - If you use an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} module instead of a development board, you need to reserve the UART/USB pins (refer to {IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL} > Section Pin Description for more details) and one of the following conditions needs to be met:

    - Reserve the Strapping pins (refer to {IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL} > Section Strapping Pins for more details), and enter the download mode by controlling the Strapping pin level.
    - Enter the download mode by sending :ref:`AT+RST=1,1 <cmd-RST>` command.

  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Series
  ------------------------

  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} AT uses two UART ports: UART0 is used to download firmware and log output; UART1 is used to send AT commands and receive AT responses. Both UART0 and UART1 use ``115200`` baud rate for communication by default.

  All {IDF_TARGET_NAME} modules use GPIO1 and GPIO3 as UART0, but they use different GPIOs as UART1. The following sections illustrate which GPIOs you should connect for each {IDF_TARGET_NAME} series of modules.

  For more details of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} modules and boards, please refer to `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} modules <https://espressif.com/en/products/modules?id={IDF_TARGET_NAME}>`_ and `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} boards <https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits?id={IDF_TARGET_NAME}>`_.

  If you want to connect your device directly with {IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}-4MB module rather than the {IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}-4MB board that integrates it, please refer to the corresponding module `datasheet <https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/technical-documents>`_ for more details.

  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Series
  ------------------------

  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} series refer to the module or board that has a built-in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip, such as {IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}-MINI series device and {IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}-WROOM series device.

  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} AT uses two UART ports: UART0 is used to download firmware and log output; UART1 is used to send AT commands and receive AT responses. Both UART0 and UART1 use ``115200`` baud rate for communication by default.

      - USB to serial converter
          * TX

          * RTS
          * CTS

  **Note** 1: Connection between individual pins of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board and the PC is already established internally on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board. You only need to provide USB cable between the board and PC.

  **Note** 2: Connection between CTS/RTS is optional, depending on whether you want to use hardware flow control.
